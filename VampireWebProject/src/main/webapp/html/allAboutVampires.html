		<h3> What wikipedia has to say</h3>
		<p>A vampire is a being from folklore that subsists by feeding on the vital 
		force (generally in the form of blood) of the living. In European folklore, 
		vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused 
		mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were 
		alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy 
		or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire 
		which dates from the early 19th century.</p>
		<p>Vampiric entities have been recorded in most cultures; the term vampire 
		was popularised in Western Europe after reports of an 18th century mass 
		hysteria of a pre-existing folk belief in the Balkans and Eastern Europe 
		that in some cases resulted in corpses being staked and people being accused
		of vampirism.[1] Local variants in Eastern Europe were also known by 
		different names, such as shtriga in Albania, vrykolakas in Greece and 
		strigoi in Romania.</p>
		<p>In modern times, the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity,
		although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still 
		persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been 
		ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of decomposition after death
		and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this, 
		creating the figure of the vampire to explain the mysteries of death. 
		Porphyria was linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much 
		media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.[2][3]</p>
		<p>The charismatic and sophisticated vampire of modern fiction was born in 
		1819 with the publication of The Vampyre by John Polidori; the story was 
		highly successful and arguably the most influential vampire work of the 
		early 19th century.[4] Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula is remembered as 
		the quintessential vampire novel and provided the basis of the modern 
		vampire legend. The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire 
		genre, still popular in the 21st century, with books, films, and television 
		shows. The vampire has since become a dominant figure in the horror genre.</p>
